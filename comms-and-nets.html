<div style="border: 2px solid #2196F3; border-radius: 10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #E3F2FD; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>🔑 Key Concept:</strong> Serial transmission sends data one bit at a time over a single channel, while parallel transmission sends multiple bits simultaneously over multiple channels. </div>
This topic is about the exchange of data between devices, commonly referred to as nodes.

<div style="border: 2px solid #FF9800; border-radius: 10px; padding: 15px; background-color: #FFF3E0; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> CSMA/CA is used in WiFi networks to avoid collisions, unlike CSMA/CD used in wired Ethernet. </div>

# Communication

## Communication Methods

- Define serial and parallel transmission methods and discuss the advantages of serial over parallel transmission.
- Define and compare synchronous and asynchronous data transmission.
- Describe the purpose of start and stop bits in asynchronous data transmission.

## Communication Basics

Define:
- baud rate
- bit rate
- bandwidth
- latency
- protocol

- Differentiate between baud rate and bit rate.
- Understand the relationship between bit rate and bandwidth.

# Networking

## Topology

Understand:
- physical star topology
- logical bus network topology

And:
- differentiate between them
- explain their operation

## Networking between Hosts

Explain the following and describe situations where they might be used:
- peer-to-peer networking
- client-server networking

## Explain the purpose of WiFi

- Be familiar with the components required for wireless networking.
- Be familiar with how wireless networks are secured.
- Explain the wireless protocol Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) with and without Request to Send / Clear to Send (RTS/CTS).
- Be familiar with the purpose of Service Set Identifier (SSID).
